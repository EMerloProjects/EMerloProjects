ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EMerloProjects, personal repository of: me.

I have very short memory when it comes to coding and since my job is mainly as a mechanical engineer I just copy old code written before into new projects.

If you are one of the... none.. people visting my page just feel free to copy the code as you wish: I certainly did the same thing the first time.

Best Regards,
and as always "make cool s**t and put it on the internet"!
